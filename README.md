Important!:
- You need to have a 00_countries.txt file in your common/country_tags;

A first release of a simple program that helps you edit hoi4 states.
This program doesnt have a certificate, so you will have to click 
"Keep anyway" when download finishes and also click "Trust this program" before installing it.
For this program to become a trusted one I would need to buy a certificate for around 60â‚¬ ðŸ˜” 
(Can be bought with enough donations).
